Intro

History - liking puzzles and murderous maths
Refine full stack skills, complexity of games, different than typical full stack app

I've always liked puzzles, from Sudoku to games like [Antichamber](https://store.steampowered.com/app/219890/Antichamber/).
Rarely it seems that is there's a particular puzzle I really enjoy, there is an abundance of it around to keep me satisfied. On top of that,
ideas always pop up for how to tweak the puzzle rules to make it more interesting or more difficult. That's one of the joys of writing software,
it gives me the ability to make those ideas come to fruition.

[Kjarposko puzzles], abbreviated "K-puzz", were created by [Kjartan Poskitt] and published by [Murderous Maths]. This is an example of a case
where I wish there were more Kjarposko puzzles from the official source. I've never seen these types of puzzles outside of the Murderous Maths
book I had as a kid.

In making what is effectively a clone of K-puzz, I wanted to use this opportuity to refine my full-stack skills. The complexity that
arises from the interactive elements of puzzles and games yields a set of challenges that are different from a typcal full-stack application.

I didn't plan on changing the rules of K-puzz at all. The innovation instead comes from the way the puzzles are implmented on a web application
and the accompanying UX. I wanted the puzzles to be programmatically generated on the fly and to be random. Typically self-contained logic puzzles
similar to K-puzz or Sudoku are hand-crafted and the data for each individual puzzle are stored on a database. I don't want to manually write
hundreds of puzzles (and if I needed to I'd probably come up with a method to programmatically generate them anyways). This allows for an
effectively infinite pool of puzzles with almost no storage required. Of course being able go back to previous puzzles played is a must-have
feature, so the puzzle generation needs to be deterministic.

In pursuit of improving my skills, I decided to use React for the front end. I already had some experience with React, however not in the area
of interactivty required by K-puzz. This gives me an excuse to dive further into the React ecosystem, as well as understand how to incorporate it
with the back end into a full-stack project.

T

Start with front end, get data format for puzzles
matrix? or something else?
programmatically generate puzzles and display
Translate between IDs and puzzles?
Decide backend and DB

A

Learned react,
ui design was straightforward
Generateing puzzles was hard
coming up with algorithem AND writing efficient code
found something that works
Path finding involved tricky algorithms, leetcode practice helped
shortest path with obstacles
Learned node and express, decided on postgres as indusry standards.
GET IDs based on time, store puzzle data and ids in DB
Practically, not great, requires http requests and DB storage, history of all puzzles generated not necssary
But excuse to make a full stack app
Can refactor to front end only for live demo

R

end result works
first react project, code is messy, room for refactoring.
puzzle generatino on client is potentially taxing

L

Learned lots of react, picked up node adn express as well
Better at UI/UX
Again, learned more about what there is to learn

Conclusion

Future improvements, separate ids by puzzle size
add query strings for puzzle id
pause button
share results link
More than MVP, i'm happy

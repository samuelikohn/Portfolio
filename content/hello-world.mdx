I'm using this post to test out MDX and make sure everything is working correctly.

## What's This Blog All About?

This blog will serve as a way for me to share my projects, experiences, and thoughts.
Perhaps I'll even try out and review new technologies as they come out.
For now, I’m testing the waters and making sure everything looks good. Stay tuned for more meaningful content soon.

## Testing MDX Features

All the markdown basics are still here:

## Headers
### Sub-headers
#### Sub-sub-headers

<br/>

### Lists

- Unordered lists with `-` or `*`
- Ordered lists with numbers

1. First item
2. Second item

### Code Snippets

Inline `code snippets` retain the backticks encasing them. However, code blocks work as usual:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

### Links

### Images

### React Components

The advantage of using MDX over traditional markdown (among many other things) is that you can embed React components directly into the `.mdx` file!
For example, here's your basic counter component:

<Counter />
